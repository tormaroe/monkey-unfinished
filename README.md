# monkey-unfinished

This repository contains a partial implementation in C# of an interpreter for the [Monkey programming language](https://monkeylang.org/).
It's intended to be used in a language implementation workshop.

The docs folder contains instructions for implementing functions and function calls in three steps (lexer, parser, and evaluator).
